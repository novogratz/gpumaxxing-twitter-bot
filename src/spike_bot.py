"""Spike orchestrator — when one of our posts takes off, all bots converge.

Most growth on X happens AROUND a single viral moment. The first hour
after takeoff is where 80% of the reach lands. Default bot behavior is
to keep posting new things; that DILUTES the spike. This bot does the
opposite: when it detects a viral spike on our own profile, it pauses
new-content cycles for ~60min and amplifies the spike from every angle.

Strategy:
  - Every 8 min, scrape /gpumaxxing for posts taking off (>= SPIKE_LIKES).
  - On first detection of a spike (URL not seen yet):
       1. Auto-pin it (override daily pin lock).
       2. Self-RT it via retweet_post (push it onto every follower's feed).
       3. Generate + post an in-thread follow-up (extends the punchline).
       4. Skip old quote-RT promo; plain repost already happened.
       5. Like top replies on it (boosts thread engagement).
  - Persistent dedup so we don't re-orchestrate the same spike.

"{post_text}"

The tweet is taking off. Time to extend. Write ONE short FOLLOW-UP
sentence, posted as a reply to your own tweet, that:
- rides the audience peak watching this thread
- extends the joke or adds one more brutal layer
- keeps the meme effect going

LANGUAGE: match the original tweet. English original -> English follow-up.
French original -> French follow-up. No mixing.

🎯 THIS IS YOUR VIRAL MOMENT. Make it count. The follow-up must be
AS FUNNY or FUNNIER than the original. The audience is scrolling your
profile — this is the reply that makes them follow.

PREFERRED SHAPES (pick one, make it savage):
  - Anti-climax: "Huge launch. Revolutionary. The font was beautiful."
  - Mini-dialogue: "- But how?" / "- Nobody knows."
  - Renaming: "This is how I learned about my 401(k). Via memes."
  - Understatement: "Mild concern at the all-hands."
  - Callback: "Edit: forgot to mention the part where the math doesn't work."
  - Absurd comparison: "The AI industry is a casino where the house also gambles."

RULES:
- Max 200 characters.
- No emojis. No hashtags. No em dashes (—).
- No meta words ("Update:", "Bonus:", "More seriously"). Extend the bit.
- Use ONE exact detail from the original tweet for specificity.
- If nothing strong -> output exactly: SKIP

Output ONLY the follow-up text, or SKIP."""
