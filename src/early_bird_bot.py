"""Early-bird bot: catch fresh tweets from mega accounts within minutes.

Why this matters more than any other reply path: being in the TOP 5 replies
on a viral tweet is a 10-100x impressions multiplier vs. landing as reply
#50 an hour later. The standard reply bot fires every 20 min — too slow to
consistently land top-5 on a fresh banger from sama / OpenAI / Mathieu.

Strategy:
- Every 5 min, pick a few mega accounts at random.
- Scrape their latest tweets (existing scraper).
- If any tweet is < 12 min old AND we haven't replied yet → reply NOW.
- Hard cap 1 reply per cycle. Lock-before-post URL dedup. Same dead-tweet
  filter as direct_reply (won't reply to tweets with 0 engagement YET — but
  the threshold is loose because fresh tweets often have 0 likes).
- Source-tagged "EARLYBIRD/<handle>" so the strategy agent sees it.
