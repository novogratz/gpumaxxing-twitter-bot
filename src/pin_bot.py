"""Pin-best-tweet bot — auto-pin our highest-engagement own POST.

Why this matters: a strong pinned tweet is the #1 leverage point on
follow-conversion. Every visitor sees it first; if it's a banger, they
follow. If it's stale, they bounce. We post a lot — the pinned slot
should rotate to whatever is currently working.

Strategy:
  - Once per day, scrape /gpumaxxing (main feed, posts only — NOT
    /with_replies which mixes replies in).
  - Pick the post with the highest like count from the last ~30 tweets
    (the visible profile window).
  - Skip if already pinned (track via pin_history.json).
  - Pin via twitter_client.pin_own_tweet (best-effort JS menu click).
