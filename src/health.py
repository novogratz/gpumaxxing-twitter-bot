"""Health watchdog: detect stuck Safari and recover.

The whole stack runs through Safari + AppleScript. If Safari hangs (memory
pressure, redirect loop, OS update, captive portal), every cycle silently
errors and the bot looks alive but accomplishes nothing. This module:

  1. Counts consecutive cycle failures across the whole bot (process-wide,
     persisted so a restart doesn't lose context).
  2. After RECOVERY_THRESHOLD failures in a row, force-quits Safari and
     reopens a fresh window — usually clears whatever wedged it.
  3. Writes a single-line flag into autonomous_log.md when recovery fires
     so the user sees it on return.

The counter resets on any successful cycle. By design this is per-bot
(across reply / engage / post / etc.) — three failed cycles in a row from
ANY mix of bots is the trigger, since they all share Safari.
