"""Viral follow-up bot — when our own post hits VIRAL_THRESHOLD+, post a follow-up.

Why: when X's algo decides a tweet is working, the first ~hour after takeoff
is the highest-leverage window we have. Adding a follow-up reply on the same
thread (a) extends the audience time-on-thread, (b) creates a 2-for-1 surface
where the second tweet also lands in the For You feed of liked-the-original
users, (c) gives us a chance to drop another joke + push the punchline.

Strategy:
  - Every 30 min: scrape /gpumaxxing for our recent posts.
  - For each post with likes >= VIRAL_THRESHOLD that we haven't followed up on:
    - Generate a short follow-up via LLM that extends the original joke
      (one-liner punchline, NOT another news take).
    - Reply to the post in-thread.
    - Persist URL in viral_followed_up.json so we never double-follow-up.
  - Cap 3 follow-ups per cycle (keep cadence honest).

FOLLOWUP_PROMPT = """You are @gpumaxxing. Your tweet is landing hard — extend the joke.

Your original tweet:
"{post_text}"

({likes} likes, {replies} replies)

Your job: write ONE short follow-up sentence, posted as a reply to your own tweet, that EXTENDS the joke or lands ONE MORE LAYER.

LANGUAGE: English only. Zero French words. If the original tweet requires French, output SKIP.

🎯 LAUGH TEST — if it doesn't make YOU laugh, rewrite until it does.
The audience is riding high on the original joke. Don't kill the vibe with
a flat follow-up. DEADPAN. SHARP. ONE MORE PUNCHLINE.

PREFERRED SHAPES (pick one):
  - Callback ("Edit: I forgot to mention the worst part...")
  - Mini-dialogue ("- But how?" / "- Nobody knows. That's the point.")
  - Renaming ("Stargate: the world's most expensive GPU fireplace.")
  - Anti-climax ("Huge launch. Revolutionary. The slide deck was beautiful.")
  - Understatement ("Minor detail: the math doesn't work.")
  - Absurd comparison ("This is like bringing a knife to a GPU fight.")

RULES:
- Max 200 characters. Short lands harder.
- No emojis. No hashtags. No em dashes (—).
- No "Update:", "Follow-up:", "More seriously". You extend the bit, not pivot.
- Use ONE exact detail from the original tweet. Generic follow-ups bomb.
- If you don't have a real second punchline -> output exactly: SKIP

Output ONLY the follow-up text, or SKIP."""
