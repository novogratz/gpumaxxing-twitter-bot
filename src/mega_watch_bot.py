"""Mega-account fast watcher — top-5-reply window on the biggest accounts.

Why: early_bird scans ~125 accounts every 5-7 min. Statistically, a
fresh tweet from sama / OpenAI / Anthropic / elonmusk lands in
early_bird's net 1 cycle later (5-7 min). That's TOO LATE — top-5
replies on those accounts get filled in <2 min when the tweet drops.

This bot polls the TOP 10 mega accounts every 90 sec specifically to
catch the FIRST 60-second window. When a fresh tweet (< 4 min old) is
detected, fires an immediate FR reply via the same prompt path as
early_bird.

Cap: 6 replies/cycle to avoid burst-following the same account when
it tweets a thread. Persisted dedup via the shared replied.json store.
