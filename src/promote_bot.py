"""Promote-best-reply bot — repost our highest-engagement reply.

Replies are the bot's working surface (consistent likes + comments). But
they live INSIDE someone else's thread — invisible to followers scrolling
their timeline. Solution: once a reply hits a meaningful like count,
plain-repost it so it gets another feed pass. Same content, different
distribution surface.

Strategy:
  - Once every ~3h. Visit /gpumaxxing/with_replies, scrape recent replies +
    their like counts.
  - Filter: must be authored by @gpumaxxing, must have ≥ MIN_LIKES.
  - Skip if already promoted (persistent dedup in promoted_replies.json).
  - Plain-repost the top candidate.
  - Cap 3/day so we don't feel mechanical.

Different from quote_tweet_bot (which reposts external tweets):
this reposts OUR OWN replies that already proved they land.
